### Kumaran Venkataraman
#### Full Stack Developer who likes to [learn|break|fix] things

I am a passionate developer who loves to code and create things new. Love to hack things in learn and learn new languages (spoken and programming). Love solving complex problems and building massively scalable systems.

Programmer from a very young age and an advocate of writing clean code. Has a gamut of experience in building backend & mobile applications in both Object oriented and functional paradigm. Has worked with various tech but my recent favourites are Kotlin, Elixir and Rust.

You may find more about me from my [Github profile](https://github.com/kumaranvram) and [LinkedIn profile](https://in.linkedin.com/in/kumaranvram).

This blog is just a place to record my learnings and thoughts and they __do not reflect the opinions of my current or previous employers__.

Wanna catch up for a cuppa and talk about tech? Or teach me the language that you speak? Drop me an email at m e [a t] k u m a r a n v r a m [d o t] c o m
