Well, this is a fresh start! Welcome to my blog (again)!

This is my first blogging experience with Octopress and I thought that would be a better topic to start this blog with. Earlier my blog was in [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) and I had no plans of migrating my blog to any other blogging platform. With the crash of the backend MySQL, I lost all of my previous blogs and had to start over again. Then, well, here I am.

Then I came to know about Octopress and I was fascinated by the fact that it is a blogging framework for hackers. It is a static blog generator built in Ruby. The bloggers have to write the blogs in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), static HTML pages are generated from these markdowns; these pages are deployed to the server and rendered then. That is one less headache to worry about! I no longer need a PHP engine to run on the server.

So thus you are now reading this on the Octopress platform and let us hope this keeps me fascinated to write posts more often.
